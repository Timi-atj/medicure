Project Overview
MedMind is a smart, AI-enhanced web application designed to revolutionize healthcare empower individuals through artificial intelligence by offering intelligent disease prediction based on reported symptoms, offering in home remedies for immediate medical attention and also connecting to close by health services for easy access to health Facilities through machine learning and an intuitive and user-friendly interface. So basically users receive a list of likely conditions, confidence scores, and recommended home remedies ‚Äî all while also being able to ask general health diagnosis using built-in AI capabilities.
MedMind doesn't replace doctors ‚Äî instead, it puts accessible, AI-powered health support at your fingertips, especially for those in underserved or remote regions.
